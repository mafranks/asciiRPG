This is a text based adventure I'm making for fun.  I've always been a big fan of the old style, turn based RPG.  Since I'm not currently skilled in any artistic sense, I decided to make my game text based only.  Maybe some day I'll get around to making a graphical intereface. 

You move around the game with W,S,A,D and try to level up high enough to get the key from the Mayor (not coded yet).  Once you have the key, you can get into the cave and fight the dragon to save the royal family.  

There is an item shop available to purchase items and a magic shop to purchase spells.  

This is still very much a work in progress. I'm working on it as I have free time and hope to get it finished within a month or two.  Please let me know if you find any bugs!
